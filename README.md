This project was made for CS 341 by:
- Stephen Behnke
- Matthew Kotras
- Hailey Vadnais
- Sebastian Vang.

This specific GitHub repository is a copy of the original private project.
The project originally ran on a MySql database provided by the school, and was converted to use a local sql database.

Note: Push history was lost from the original project. I did not do the entire project solo as the commit history appears to show.
