<h2>Main Window - Sample Script</h2>

This is a sample script made with Script Buddy. 

In this specific script, if the user would type 'btw' and then press the space or enter key, it would instantly be replaced with 'by the way'. 

Pressing the 'c' key performs the indented actions. Creation of a script like that above can be performed using the windows below.

<h2>Properties Window</h2>

Each action of the script can be selected and a unique properties window will be loaded for the selected action. Properties within this properties window can be updated and will change in real-time.

This specific GitHub repository is a copy of the original private project.
The project originally ran on a MySql database provided by the school, and was converted to use a local sql database.

Note: Push history was lost from the original project. I did not do the entire project solo as the commit history appears to show.
